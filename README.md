# Educage 🧠🐭  
**Behavioral Experiments for Mice!**
---

## Overview

**Educage** is a complete software-and-hardware solution for running behavioral experiments with mice — designed with tired PhD students in mind.

Whether you're training mice in auditory discrimination tasks or running custom paradigms, Educage helps streamline the process and make data collection and analysis easier and more robust.

> Plug in your mice. Press run. Go make coffee.

## Features ✨

- 🧠 **User-friendly GUI** for setting up and running experiments  
- 🐭 **Compatible with standard behavioral cages** (e.g., with sound delivery, water reward, and sensors)  
- 📊 **Automated data collection** in txt format  
- 📈 **Built-in plotting** of behavioral metrics like d-prime and score distributions  
- 🧪 **Easily customizable** for different paradigms  
- 🔌 **Hardware integration** (e.g., Raspberrypi, TDT system)
